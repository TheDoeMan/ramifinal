Tunisian Rami Game Logic Guide
🎯 Objective of the Game
Players aim to form valid melds (sets or runs) from the cards in their hand and discard one card to end their turn, eventually trying to get rid of all cards or finish with the lowest score.

1. 🔄 Game Flow (Turn-Based Loop)
Each player's turn must follow this sequence strictly:

✅ Valid Turn Steps:
Draw One Card (from deck OR discard pile)

Meld (Optional) – Lay down valid combinations (sets or runs) if player has valid ones.

Discard One Card (mandatory) – Ends the turn.

At any point, a player must not have more than one extra card than starting hand size (i.e. hand size = original + 1).

2. 🃎 Starting the Game
🔹 Initial Setup:
2–4 players.

Deck: 2x 52-card decks (104 cards total).

Each player is dealt 14 cards.

The remaining deck is the draw pile.

The top card of the draw pile goes to the discard pile (if allowed by rules).

3. 🧠 Player Turn Rules (Enforced Logic)
➕ DRAW PHASE
Player must draw one card:

Either from the deck (draw pile)

OR from the discard pile (top card only)

❌ Player cannot draw from both.

❌ Player cannot draw more than once per turn.

🧩 MELD PHASE (Optional)
Player may lay down:

Set: 3 or more cards of the same rank but different suits (e.g., 7♣ 7♦ 7♠)

Run: 3 or more consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 5♠ 6♠ 7♠)

Melds must follow these rules:

At least 3 cards per meld

No duplicate suits in sets

No repeating values in runs

Melds can be added to on later turns if already laid down

➖ DISCARD PHASE
Player must discard exactly one card to the discard pile

The discarded card cannot be:

The same card just drawn from the discard pile (to prevent cycling)

4. 🔁 Melding Scenarios
✅ Valid Melds:
Set: A♠ A♦ A♥

Run: 9♣ 10♣ J♣

❌ Invalid Melds:
A♠ A♠ A♣ (duplicate suit)

3♣ 5♣ 6♣ (non-consecutive run)

2♦ 2♦ 2♦ (same suit)

5. 🚫 Common Rule Violations to Prevent
Violation	Fix Needed
Drawing more than 1 card	Block second draw in turn
Discarding before drawing	Disallow until draw is done
Discarding more than 1 card	Force exactly 1 discard
Melding invalid sets/runs	Validate before laying down
Finishing turn without discarding	Prevent turn end without discard
Drawing from discard then discarding same card	Disallow

6. 🏁 End Game Conditions
Game ends when a player has no cards left after discard.

Or, the draw pile is empty (depending on variant rules).

7. 🧮 Scoring (Basic)
Player with no cards: 0 points

Other players: Total of unmatched cards in hand

Optional: Face cards = 10, Aces = 1 or 11, others = face value

8. 👨‍💻 AI-Enforced Game States
Phase	Allowed Actions	Forbidden Actions
Draw Phase	Draw 1 card	Draw again, Discard
Meld Phase	Lay valid melds	Lay invalid melds
Discard Phase	Discard 1 card	Skip discard, discard 2 cards
Post Discard	End turn	Take actions

9. 🧪 Suggested Test Scenarios for Debugging
Draw → Discard only (no meld): ensure valid loop

Draw → Invalid meld → Discard: meld rejected, turn continues

Draw from discard → Try to discard same card: block

Attempt to meld 2 cards: block

Try discarding 2 cards: block

Try to end turn without discard: block

Player hand count exceeds 15: reset or warn
